            Regarding the application prototype and the website, the process of the journey is certainly challenging especially with restricted knowledge regarding the application prototype. Before creating this product, I only created one other application prototype for a school assignment. This is the exact same for the website as well, prior to this website, I have only created one other website. As for the product itself, I believe that it just takes time to master the basics of Figma, once you have mastered it, then designing the app layout should be easier. There are also plenty of tutorials on Google and Youtube to help you create your application prototype.

            <br>
            As for the whole process itself, I started by planning out what I want to create, once I have made up my mind on what I would like to create for my project. I went into creating the layouts needed for the application prototype. In total, I ended up creating 28 different layouts with 11 different pages. This didnâ€™t include the pages counted for the overlays and extra frames made. In the end, I have a sum of 86 pages, which certainly is a great amount. After the process of different layouts, I went to interview 4 people, 2 Visual Arts students, 1 Digital Design student, and 1 Personal and Professional skill teacher. Next, I proceeded to the creation of the website, which is the website you are currently visiting.

            In the matter of the application prototype and the website, I certainly want to expand both the app prototype as well as the website in the future. My current plan if things do go well is that I want to add more mental disorders (such as Sleep Deprivation, Depression, Panic Disorder, Anxiety, PTSD, and Bipolar Disorder) so that this application prototype can meet the needs of more people. As for the website, I would like to advance the elements and create better access for those who visit the website. Once things go well, I would like to advertise the website and application prototype on other social media, mainly Tik Tok and or Instagram. The way in the future, if the majority of people have the desire to turn this into an actual app, then I will do that too.
