            Hello! I am Stefanni, currently, I am 15 years old. I made this website and application prototype for my personal project. As a short background, I am from Indonesia and lived there ever since. Currently, I am in Grade 10 receiving my education at Tzu Chi School in Jakarta.  I have always taken an interest towards Social Science, especially when it comes to work that involves problem-solving and solving things in general. Aside from that, I also took an interest in technology, although not for the content but mostly for the benefits it holds for the future. Therefore, I would be delighted if I am able to expand my skills, mainly focusing on software development. Knowing this, I took the time to create a website and prototype application to relate to my interest while expanding my skills and knowledge in software development.
            <br>
            <br>
            As for my values, I believe that doing good in the world in a way that doesn’t bring harm to others will always benefit you in some ways. Whether it would be directly or indirectly. Knowing people who suffer from mental disorders and knowing you can help in some way, even if it’s an insignificant amount. It would still bring me delight knowing that I can help someone with their lives. As said, the website and application prototype I made are free for anyone to use.
