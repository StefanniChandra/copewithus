        			Cope With Us is an application prototype that serves 5 mental disorders, which are Social Anxiety, Dysgraphia, ADHD, Eating Disorder and Hearing Impairment. The function of the app is to help ease those who have these mental disorders by providing them with guides that I think would be useful for them. Aside from that, Cope With Us also provides the feature of spreading awareness and learning new information regarding these 5 mental disorders. Therefore, the app is not limited to only those who have to deal with the 5 mental disorders but also the general public. As for the information, I provided the app with 4 main pieces of information, which are the definition, symptoms, possible treatments, and how to help those who deal with these mental disorders. Each mental disorder would be provided with a guide and all 4 of the information.

              As a quick overview, here are the guidance provided for each mental disorder listed.

        		As for the app prototype itself is created on a website called Figma. In Figma, there are two main parts you need to focus on, which are the design and the prototype. The design category is the part where you would like to edit or change on how your app would look like or the aesthetics of your application. You can do this by using the tools provided by Figma, which isn’t that complicated to do once you have a basic understanding of Figma. Although, the prototype category is certainly way more challenging than the design category since this is when you make things work. For example, if you would like to make a popup, a button, or change into another frame, you will have to edit it all here. With various links linking to each other, it can certainly be overwhelming to look at. Now for the actual application prototype, I have added it to this website if you want to try it out (scroll below).

          <p>
            Cope With Us was created something that was beneficial to others in a way that isn’t usually directly provided to them. There are unlimited quantities of oppose to information people can find regarding these mental disorders but what usually is lacking is the application/website to help them with the actual disorder. Therefore, I decided to provide those who deal with these certain mental disorders an opportunity to get guidance at no expense. Obviously, this guidance isn’t as professional compared to getting professional help, although most people struggle financially and can’t afford those types of professional services. Another aspect of the reason for creating this application prototype is that more and more people are suffering from mental disorders or at least more people are open to it. Therefore, creating an application prototype as such would hopefully be beneficial to someone.
